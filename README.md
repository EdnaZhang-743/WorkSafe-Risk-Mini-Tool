## 🧭 How to Use

#### Step 1 – Identify 
Go to “New Assessment” tab and fill in:

Task name (e.g., “Box lifting”)
Load weight (kg)
Frequency per hour
Posture type (e.g., bending, repetitive upper limb, pushing/pulling)

#### Step 2 – Assess
The system automatically generates a risk score based on your inputs.
You can view results immediately in the Overview tab.

#### Step 3 – Control
Based on the calculated risk, the tool provides control suggestions, such as:

Use lifting aids
Rotate tasks
Reduce frequency
Provide ergonomic training

#### Step 4 – Review
Use the History & Trends tab to view past data, compare tasks, and observe progress.
Charts display risk trends and allow filtering by date or task type.

#### Step 5 – Monitor 
Regularly import/export updated CSV data for ongoing monitoring.
All information can be shared or reviewed offline — no database needed.
